## What is Brickwork & Pointing?
**1) Brickwork:** The process of laying, repairing, or restoring bricks to build strong, lasting structures.

**2) Pointing:** The technique of repairing or renewing mortar joints between bricks. Over time, mortar deteriorates due to NYCâ€™s harsh weather, leading to cracks, water infiltration, and structural risks.

Professional brick pointing services in New York City restore the strength of your walls, prevent leaks, and extend the life of your building.

## Why Brickwork & Pointing is Essential in New York City
New Yorkâ€™s climateâ€”with icy winters, heavy rains, and hot summersâ€”takes a toll on masonry. Without proper maintenance, bricks can crack, and mortar can crumble, causing:

âœ… **Water damage to interiors**

âœ… **Weakened structures that reduce property value**

âœ… **Unsafe conditions due to loose bricks**

âœ… **Loss of curb appeal**

Thatâ€™s why timely repointing and brick repair services are vital for property owners.
